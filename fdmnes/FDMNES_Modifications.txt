                    List of corrections and modifications

8 January 2007
   
- For 1 year, for the 4f elements, the screening was by default on the 5d, 
  it is now again by default on the 4f.
--> This can modify the results comparing with previous version

- Better output in bav file to get the atomic electronic configurations.

10 January 2007

- Anormal memory increase under MPI on some compiler corrected (by R. Wilcke)
- Bad initialisation of naltm parameter corrected (previously could stop the program).

15 January 2007

- Bug found and corrected when 2 fold axis along x (or y) and symmetry plane
 along y=z (or x=z). (Occured just in FDM).

19 January 2007

- Bug found and corrected when symmetry plane along y=z (or x=z) and no symmetry
 plane for y=0 and z=0 (or x=0 and z=0). (Occured just in FDM).

 6 February 2007

- Bug found and corrected for the automatic screening in magnetic configuration
when the non excited electronic configuration is such that there is less than
 half electron free for one of the spin for the orbital where comes the screening electron
(very rare situation).
- Establishment of the groups of equivalent atoms made less memory consuming. Previously
when the number of non equivalent atoms was to high one got stack overflow.

14 February 2007

- In routine Symsite, declaration of base_orth as logical forgotten previously. Gave problem
in compilation with some compiler

March-June 2007
